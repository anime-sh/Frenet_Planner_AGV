Introduction
============

This is an implementation for a sampling based planner in frenet frame. 
The `original paper <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224156269_Optimal_Trajectory_Generation_for_Dynamic_Street_Scenarios_in_a_Frenet_Frame>`_ discusses about converting normal coordinate frame to frenet frame & sampling of paths, selecting the them based on cost associated with each path.

Use Case
========

The planner has been tested in various environments. But is formed & found to be useful for high speed scenarios with minimal curves in path. This converts to highway scenario in the the physical world.

The planner runs at 25 Hz under single-threaded operation on a modern pc.

There are a lot of cases that require dynamic consideration of other traffic participants for complex maneuvers like merging into traffic flow, passing with on-coming traffic, changing lanes, or avoiding other vehicles. 

Heuristics based planners sort all these quite easily. But in cases of time sparsity these planners don't perform well. So there in comes the concept of taking time **'t'** into consideration at planning & execution level. This is what the planner handles through taking maneuver time into account in sampling.
